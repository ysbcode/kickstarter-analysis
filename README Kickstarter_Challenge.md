# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
From our initial analysis we found the most successful and high volume campaign category was Theater and plays subcategory
### Purpose
Our purpose is to find out the success and failure of campaign based on Launch Date during the year and Goal amount
## Analysis and Challenges
We performed our analysis in a structured way and tackeled one category at a time
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The below line chart shows our analysis based on Launch Date and we can see the major volume is mid of the year

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* Using COUNTIFS function but used google and examples given in the lesson and figured out how to select and filter different ranges.
* Uploading Resource as a folder on GitHub. Found out the easiest way to do that is drag and drop the entire forler.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* Mid of the year records high volumes and month of May has highest number of successful and failed campaigns.
* End of the year and December month have almost equal number of successful and failed campaigns.
___
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* With lower Goal target the percentage of successful campaigns is higher.
* With Goal target above 45000 percentage of failed campaigns is highest and successful campaigns is lowest.
___
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
* This data set is only for a span of nine years.
* The last data set available is for the year 2017.
___
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
* We could create a box plot for plays based on Goals.
* We could create bar charts for plays subcategory displaying what plays were most successful.
